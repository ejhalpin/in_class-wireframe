    <p>
        I've been coding for about 10 years. I began by teaching myself Java in grad school. Shortly after I picked up some
        javascript and css. I have only recently been pursuing a career using the skills I have taught myself. To bring credibility 
        to my pursuit and to fill in the myriad gaps of my knowledge I joined a coding bootcamp hosted by Trilogy in cooperation
        with UNC Chapel Hill.
